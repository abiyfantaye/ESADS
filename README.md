# ESADS
ESADS is a structural analysis and design software developed based on the Ethiopian Building Code of Standards(EBCS-1995). This code is written together with my colleagues during our undergraduate study. The executable version of the program can be downloaded from `Excutables/ESADS_Setup.msi`. Using ESADS, one can analyze and design the following reinforced concrete structures:

- Beam
- Biaxial columns 
- Foundation footings  


The software has the following key features: 

- Efficeint desing procedure 
- Shows intermediate outputs 
- Export the final rebar details to AutoCAD 


The implemented numerical details of the program for each structural component are described in the report. Please check `DOC/ESADS_Final_Report`.
